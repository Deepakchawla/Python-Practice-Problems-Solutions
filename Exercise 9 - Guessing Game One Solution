#Exercise 9

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them 
whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the 
very first exercise)

Extras:
Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

#Solution

import random
count = 0
loop_value = 1
print("\"You can exit any by typing exit on screen...\"\n")
while loop_value:
  num = input("Guess any number between 1 to 9:")
  count += 1
  if num == "exit":
    print("You Guess", count-1 , "times in whole game...")
    break
  elif num.isnumeric():
    rand_num = random.randint(1,10)
    num = int(num)
    if num not in range(1,10):
      print("You Guess out of range value")
    elif num == rand_num:
      print("You Guess exactly right number")
    elif num < rand_num:
      print("You Guess low value")
    elif num > rand_num:
      print("You Guess high value")
  loop_value = 1
