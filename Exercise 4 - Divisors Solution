#Exercise 4

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a 
divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

#Solution

number = int(input("Enter a number for its divisor:"))
num_list = list(range(1, number+1))
num_list_new = []
for value in num_list:
  if number % value == 0:
    num_list_new.append(value)
print(num_list_new)
