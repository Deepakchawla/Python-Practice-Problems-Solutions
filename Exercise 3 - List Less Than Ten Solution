#Exercise 3
Take a list, say for example this one:

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it 
and print out this new list.

2. Write this in one line of Python.

3. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than 
that number given by the user.

#Solution

list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
for value in a:
  if value < 5:
    print (value)

#Solution

Extras - 1    

list_old = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
list_new = []
for value in list_old:
  if value < 5:
    list_new.append(value)
print(list_new)

Extras - 3

list_old = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
num = int(input("Enter a number for check:"))
list_new = []
for value in list_old:
  if value < num:
    list_new.append(value)
print(list_new)
