#Exercise 8
Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a 
message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock

#Solution

new_game = "Yes"
game_control = "Enter"
player1 = input("Please enter player1 name:")
player2 = input("Please enter player2 name:")
while new_game == "Yes":
  choice1 = input(player1.title() + ", What you want to choice Rock or Paper, Sessior:").title()
  choice2 = input(player2.title() + ", What you want to choice Rock or Paper, Sessior:").title()
  if choice1 == choice2:
    print("Game has been tie")
  elif choice1 == "Rock" and choice2 == "Paper":
    print(player2, "you win")
  elif choice1 == "Rock" and choice2 == "Sessior":
    print(player1, "you win")
  elif choice1 == "Paper" and choice2 == "Rock":
    print(player1, "you win")
  elif choice1 == "Paper" and choice2 == "Sessior":
    print(player2, "you win")
  elif choice1 == "Sessior" and choice2 == "Rock":
    print(player2, "you win")
  elif choice1 == "Sessior" and choice2 == "Paper":
    print(player1, "you win")
  else:
    print("You enter worng input choice")
  new_game = input("Wants to start new game, Yes or No..??").title()
