#Exercise 1:

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them 
the year that they will turn 100 years old.

#Solution:

import time
Time = time.localtime(time.time())
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age < 100:
  year_100 = ((100-age) + Time.tm_year)
  print(name.title() + " your year is " + str(year_100) + " when you will 100 years old.")
else:
  print("Your age already more than 100.")
