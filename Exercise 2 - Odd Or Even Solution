#Exercise 2 

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. 
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides 
evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

#Soluion

number = int(input("Enter a Number for check:"))
check = int(input("Enter a Number for divide :"))

if number % 4 == 0:
  print(number, "is multiple of 4.")
elif number % 2:
  print(number, "is an Odd number.")
else:
  print(number, "is an Even number.")
  
if number % check:
  print(number, "is not divided by", check,".")
else:
  print(number,"is divided by", check,".")
